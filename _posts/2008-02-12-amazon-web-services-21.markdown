 **Abstract**

**Life in a Post Web 2.0 World**  
What’s possible in a post Web 2.0 world? Innovation continues at a mind-bending pace, and this presentation will showcase some thought-provoking new directions that Web Services are headed in. The presentation will provide an overview of Amazon Web Services, including an online storage service, a Virtual Server service, and more.&nbsp; There will also be a demo showing how to set up the virtual server. But mostly this will be an opportunity to have a discussion about innovation and entrepreneurial tools.  
&nbsp;  
Amazon spent over a decade developing a world-class technology and content platform that powers Amazon web sites for millions of customers every day. Most people think “Amazon.com” when they hear the word; however developers are excited to learn that there is a separate technology arm of the company, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. Using AWS, developers can build software applications leveraging the same robust, scalable, and reliable technology that powers Amazon’s retail business. AWS has now launched ten services with open API’s for developers to build applications, with the result that over 290,000 developers have registered on Amazon’s developer site to create applications based on these services.
