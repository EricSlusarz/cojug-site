 **Abstract**

**Welcome to COJUG, where today we are going to learn a little C. Being arguably (and in my opinion) the dominate mobile OS, Google has implemented a JVM within the Android platform. &nbsp;While we wait for a stock Apple JVM we are stuck wondering, how do we write code that leverages the advantages of both without being redundant? How do we put down our pikes and pick up plowshares by implementing modern technology within the mobile environment. By learning C and a little Java, we can make code easily portable between all environments, mobile or otherwise. Now we are living in a world of fully portable code, how do we project our environment? Finally we will look into how to leverage Java’s abstractions to make straight forward but efficent code. Life is too short to commit to one OS.**
