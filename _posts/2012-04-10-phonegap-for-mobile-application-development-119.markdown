Mobile applications have been quite hot. Companies want to take advantage of mobile platforms to accomplish critical business missions. Many individuals entertain the thought to create something cool and put it into the app store and millions of people would download or even pay for it. The problem is each mobile platform is different in operating system and programming language so requires different skill sets. That is why PhoneGap comes to play.
