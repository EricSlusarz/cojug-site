 **Abstract**  
  
GWT is a powerful toolkit for developing robust AJAX applications.&nbsp; It has many tempting features:   
+ Swing UI development style  
+ a compiler to catch warnings and errors ahead of time  
+ a compiler that optimizes for both download speed and execution speed  
+ built-in RPC with wire-size optimization and support for POJOs (think AJAX over RMI)   
  
- "Wow - that's neat!&nbsp; But I have a mature webapp already and its daunting to port it over from (STRUTS|JSF|JSP|...)".  
The good news is GWT can be used piecemeal allowing you to integrate a small bit of new or replaced functionality in your existing webapp in an unobtrusive way.   
  
We'll cover what a GWT app looks like to a developer, including frontend (widgets and events), backend (RPC) with examples and end with a demo that takes an existing Struts app and adds a new feature using GWT.&nbsp;
