 **Abstract**

Groovy and Grails have given us the ability to leverage the strength of the Java Platform (and Eco System) and the productivity of "Convention over Configuration" to construct websites.&nbsp; But what if the User Interface requirements of your new application is best solved with the type of interaction a desktop application provides?  
  
Groovy brings the same productivity gain to desktop applications that Grails brings to web applications.&nbsp; This session will use the Groovy SwingBuilder and popular open source libraries to build a desktop application to interact with a Grails backend.
