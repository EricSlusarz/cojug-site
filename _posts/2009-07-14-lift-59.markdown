 **Abstract**

Lift is a web application framework written in Scala. It applies Scala’s unique combination of OOP and Functional programming to the web application development. Through the Scala actors, it has comet support out of box. It also borrows the best ideas from various existing framework.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Seaside's highly granular sessions and security  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Rails/Grails fast flash-to-bang  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Django's "more than just CRUD is included"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \* Wicket's designer-friendly templating style  
  
We’ll explore the basic of a Lift web application. Scala knowledge would be useful, though not required for this presentation.
