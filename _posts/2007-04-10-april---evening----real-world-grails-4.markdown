 **Abstract**

&nbsp;You've heard about "Convention over Configuration" -- come see it in action. Grails is a web framework that maximizes the strengths of familiar Java libraries -- Spring, Hibernate, and Sitemesh, to name a few -- while minimizing the XML jockeying it usually takes to get them all to play nicely with one another.

**Bio**

&nbsp;Scott Davis is an author and independent consultant. He is passionate about open source solutions and agile development. He has worked on a variety of Java platforms, from J2EE to J2SE to J2ME (sometimes all on the same project).  
  
 He is the co-author of JBoss At Work, quite possibly the world's first agile J2EE book. He is also responsible for several mapping books, including Google Maps API and GIS for Web Developers: Adding Where to Your Web Applications.
