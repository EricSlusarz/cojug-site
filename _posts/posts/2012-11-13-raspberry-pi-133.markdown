 **Abstract**

The Raspberry Pi is a hot, inexpensive, new platform for learning computing skills.&nbsp; The Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized, single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of stimulating the teaching of basic computer science in schools.  
  
We'll walk through a hardware overview, including installation of the O/S and configuration of the Raspberry Pi.&nbsp; In addition to describing the hardware and software architecture, we'll provide an overview of Embedded Java and demonstrate how you can install and utilize Java SE Embedded on the Raspberry Pi to develop JavaDB, RESTful web services, Java EE and JavaFX applications.
