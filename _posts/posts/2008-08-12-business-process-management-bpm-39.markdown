 **Abstract**

Business Process Management can transform organizations into nimble, agile entities.&nbsp; It can leverage both human and technology capital effectively, and provide a framework for identifying and addressing practical problems quickly. But BPM efforts can sometimes be undermined by weak technology support, and misunderstanding about the nature of what is available. I was given the opportunity to talk about some issues that Enterprise Architects should keep in mind when approaching the topic of Business Process Management.  
  
Some of the key points are:

- BPM is a marriage between practical business needs and technology. But the end goal is to improve business. If it doesn't do so, that dog don't hunt. Hence, the technology is critical.
- Processes are not always documented. Often, they exist as undocumented tribal knowledge. It's the job of the BPM architect to articulate them.
- Articulating processes is not enough. It's critical that processes be identified for cost benefits. Fixing a beautiful, complicated problem isn't worth much if it doesn't serve a practical purpose.
- Ruby? Let's talk \*really\* about quick prototyping. Enter Lombardi TeamWorks.
