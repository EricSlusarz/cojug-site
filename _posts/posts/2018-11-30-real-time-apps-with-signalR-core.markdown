Topic
Real-time Apps with SignalR Core

Abstract
SignalR has been around for a few years now, and is considered a go-to for developers working on real-time web applications. With the release of ASP.NET Core Version 1.2 (Q2 2017), .NET developers will be able to utilize SignalR for the first time from the Core libraries. In this talk, we will review what SignalR is and how you can use it, and will also discuss the benefits of the new version contained within ASP.NET Core 1.2. We will also work with a few technical examples to help give you the tools to use SignalR Core yourself!
