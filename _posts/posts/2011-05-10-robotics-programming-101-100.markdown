 **Abstract**

Scott has rewritten his robotics API and written another book, Robotics Programming 101 (http://www.roboticsprogramming101.com) coming out in May of 2011, where the programs are written in PBASIC, Arduino, JRuby and Java. Think of this book as a lightweight quick start guide to robotics programming.  
  
During this talk heâ€™ll bring his Feynman-Jr-2 robot, [http://www.scottsbots.com/robot/feynman-jr-2](http://www.scottsbots.com/robot/feynman-jr-2) , where he will give an overview the API and demo programs ranging from basic movements to computer vision.
