 **Abstract**

Are you using Maven for your project builds because it was the least evil of the tools you could find?&nbsp; Our team was too... until we started using Gradle.&nbsp; Gradle claims to be "Build automation evolved"&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; If so, what makes it true?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will discuss the trials and travails of migrating a complex multi-module project from Maven to Gradle.&nbsp; What compelled us to make the change, and what benefits have we realized since the change was made?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also discuss the rough edges we encountered during both our migration and our day to day use.
