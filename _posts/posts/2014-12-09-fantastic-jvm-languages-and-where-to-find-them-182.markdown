 **Abstract**

When Java came on to the scene, it changed everything…. Now almost 20 years later, while the language starts to show its age, the platform continues to be as fertile as ever. The JVM is the core of this ecosystem and everyday more languages are emerging from it. Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Jython, Jruby, Ceylon, XTrend… the list goes on and on. With all these languages to choose from, how do programmers decide which languages are right for the job?  

**Bio**

Branden Bellanca is a new face in the IT crowd. After graduating in from West Virginia University in December, he jumped into the industry in the heart of Ohio. While in school, he worked as a Project Manager, helping guide the design and construction of a fully functioning, solar powered Smart House for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon.&nbsp; He has some experience in development and currently works as an automator and QA in the testing space, but is ultimately eager to continue learning and growing as a software craftsman. He has a passion to help people and eventually would like to coach and teach in the field. In his free time, Branden enjoys the outdoors (I’m a West Virginian), reading, and playing guitar.
