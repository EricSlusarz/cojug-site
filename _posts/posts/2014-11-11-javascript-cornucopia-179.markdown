 **Abstract**

JavaScript's changed a lot over the years, this talk will show you some things you might not know but are really powerful. This talk will cover the following areas: Functional Testing with CasperJS & PhantomJS. Great JS Libraries like CanvasJS, ChartJS, and RevealJS. An overview of some awesome node packages like Express, Bower and Yeoman. I'll show you how to create a node package from scratch and publish it to the npm.org. I'll also touch on a really cool technology called Node-WebKit, which is basically phonegap for desktop/pc/laptop apps. Scott will bring JavaScript powered robots to demo the code.
