 **Abstract**

Finding meaningful relationships in big data is an endeavor both fascinating and complicated. Where does one even start?  
Utilizing the power of Hadoop, the Apache Mahout project makes it easier to discover and refine data relationships using the same algorithms that power some of the Internet's largest companies to recommend movies, target advertisements, and be a romantic matchmaker. In this session you will learn about the different types of problems Mahout solves, some of the various algorithms for defining and discovering relationships, and how to refine them for improved value.
