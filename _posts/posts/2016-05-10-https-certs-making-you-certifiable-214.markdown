 **Abstract**

HTTPS/SSL/TLS certificates are a critical part of securing the Internet. For a long time Java developers were fortunate that they only needed a cursory understanding of certificates. But recently with additions of new Certificate Authorities (CA), deprecation of protocols and ciphers as well as the changes to default protocol configurations in Java 8 it has become more important to understand and be able to debug HTTPS certificate issues.  
  
This session will provide Java developers with a primer on HTTPS certificates architecture and configurations. It will explain common problems that Java developers may experience and how to debug them from a Java context. It will show you how to pin certificates as well as load CA certificates. It will also demonstrate how to create self-signed certificates so Java developers can test web applications locally over HTTPS.
