 **Abstract**

Come learn appropriate practices for Continuous Integration in an Agile age. Jenkins (a.k.a. Hudson) is a flexible CI solution. I'll walk us through its simple setup, show some of the plug-ins, and then dive into leveraging Jenkins for a multi-application, enterprise solution. I think you'll see that Jenkins can not only perform the CI duties of build with unit tests, but can also serve as a dashboard for numerous deployment and automated tasks.
