 **Abstract**

You may not realize it, but you have a Java-based software supply chain.&nbsp; There is a massive volume of open source and proprietary components being consumed within your software supply chain at a very high velocity. Within it, a lot of inefficiencies are \*hidden\* to you and are silently sabotaging your efforts to accelerate development, improve efficiency and maintain quality.&nbsp; During the meeting, I will openly share insight about your use of Java that will change the way you think about everything, and put you leagues ahead of organizations who are still in the dark.  
  
This year, I authored the 2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report - a quantitative analysis of 160,000 Java-centric development organizations that consumed 17 billion open source and proprietary software components from over 210,000 projects -- all hosted on Maven Central. While the average organization consumed 240,000 components in 2014, the study revealed evidence of inefficient software sourcing practices, building in outdated components, and using software with known security vulnerabilities or potentially risky license types by mistake.   
  
Attendees will also learn how organizations like ServiceNow, Blackboard and DHS are applying proven supply chain principles from the manufacturing industry toward improving their Java-centric DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices.&nbsp; Then, I will shed light on pending legislation in the U.S. Congress that may change the way all of us develop software in the future.  

**Bio**

I work at Sonatype -- home to Nexus repository manager, Maven Central and creators of Maven.&nbsp; In 2015, I led the largest and most comprehensive analysis of software supply chain practices to date across 160,000 development organizations. I am a huge advocate of applying proven supply chain management principles into DevOps practices to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and sustain long-lasting competitive advantages. As a 20+ year veteran of the software industry, I have advised leading businesses on IT performance improvement practices covering continuous delivery, business process management, systems and network operations, service management, capacity planning and storage management. As the VP and DevOps Advocate for Sonatype, I am passionate about changing the way people think about software supply chains and improving public safety through improved software integrity.
