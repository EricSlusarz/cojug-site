 **Abstract**

Enterprise integration is a hard problem. Not only you have deal with multiple applications build using various programming languages and&nbsp;   
deployed in various platforms, they also speak different protocols. In this presentation we will introduce you to an open source tool   
integration framework called Apache Camel. This tool implements all the well know integration patterns from "Enterprise Integration Patterns"   
book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf and provides you with a nice DSL to integration heterogeneous systems.   
  
Here is the outline of the presentation  
  
- What is Camel?  
- Talk about enterprise integration patterns  
- Camel under the hood  
- Code example integrating 2-3 applications using Camel  
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous application  
- Designing application based on message passing using Camel

I am Nilanjan Raychaudhuri working as agile coach/developer/consultant for Pillar Technology Inc. (http://pillartechnology.com/). I write software for a living. But since I enjoy creating things and solving problems, I also write software on my pastime. I am currently working on scala-webmachine (restful resource framework). In past I worked on other open source projects like Panopticode, scala-inline and autotest4j. When I am not working on projects I play with functional programming.   
  
Currently writing a book on Scala programming language called “Scala in Action” from Manning publication and run a polyglot meetup group called "Columbus Polyglot meetup group" every month.
