 **Abstract**

Learn how to take part in Java technology evolution through the Java Community Process (JCP) program. You can participate as an individual, corporation, or nonprofit such as a Java user group (JUG). This session gives you step-by-step instructions on how to participate in the JCP Program. You will also learn about the global Adopt-a-JSR program and how you can participate in the Adopt-a-JSR program. We will discuss details such as how to run hack days, collaborate with other JUG leads on Adopt-a-JSR activities, and review use cases from other JUGs around the world contributing to the Java EE 7 and Java SE 8 JSRs. Currently there are new JSRs being submitted and developed for the Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 platforms. Find out how you have contribute to the future editions of the Java Standard and Java Enterprise Editions.
