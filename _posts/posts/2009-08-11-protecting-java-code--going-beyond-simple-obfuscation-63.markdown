 **Abstract**

While Java offers an efficient framework for developing and deploying enterprise and Web 2.0 server or client-side applications, it also presents many risks. Perhaps chief among those risks with Java, being an interpreted language, is that its bytecode contains highly detailed metadata making compiled applications easy to reverse engineer, tamper and pirate. In our discussion we will consider and demonstrate some of the vulnerabilities and risks along with protection tools to pack when assessing or implementing Java application security.
