 **Abstract**

With the explosion of the cloud comes the explosion of compute power to solve complex problems. We have been playing with artificial intelligence for many years. Cloud services are now powerful enough that you can begin to build AI into your applications as simply as adding a reference to an API and a few lines of code. In this talk, we will explore Microsoft Cognitive Services and explore some real world applications. Along the way, we will code with a few of the APIs and challenge you to build smarter and more personal experiences into your applications.
