 **Abstract**

Do Rich Internet Applications need a Model View Controller (MVC) framework for the client side?&nbsp; If so, which MVC framework is best? This session will cover some fundamentals of developing Rich Clients using Adobe Flex 3.0 and the benefits of good program structure, including the use of MVC frameworks.&nbsp; It will demonstrate the use of Cairngorm, the leading MVC framework for Flex, and contrast it briefly with PureMVC and other leading frameworks.&nbsp; We’ll also look at the FlexUnit framework for testing Flex applications and put it all together through examples.
