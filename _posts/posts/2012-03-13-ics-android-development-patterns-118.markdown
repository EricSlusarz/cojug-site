 **Abstract**

With the introduction of Fragments in Honeycomb, the paradigm for Android UI development has shifted. This also introduced the need to include a compatibility library for older devices. In this session we will explore what has changed and how to implement the new patterns. We will also look into alternative development strategies such as the use of Gradle for build and dependency management, allowing for a decoupling from Eclipse.
