 **Abstract**

Java EE 6 was released as a specification on December 2009. It has many exciting new features and enhancement to most existing APIs. The good news is that GlassFish implements all of Java EE 6 today as in was released together with the specification. As we will see throughout this presentation, GlassFish is much more than a reference implementation with enterprise quality, performance, and management as well as offering a number of developer productivity features.
