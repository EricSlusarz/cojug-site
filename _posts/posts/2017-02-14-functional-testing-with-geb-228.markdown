 **Abstract**

Getting started with automation testing can be intimidating with all kinds of technologies being thrown around the conversation such as Gherkin, Selenium, cucumber, web drivers, etc. It shouldn’t be a difficult or intimidating venture to ensure that your application is behaving the way it’s intended, and that’s why this talk will cover Geb, a Groovy based automation testing framework. In this presentation, you will learn how to configure Geb and write simple tests taking advantage of some useful built-in features of Geb, all while using Spock as the testing and specification framework, allowing for highly expressive tests. You will also dive into the jQuery-ish navigation, page objects, modules, and form control shortcuts that make testing your applications a breeze.
