 **Abstract**

Come see how Grails Web Flow can be used to simplify state management and application flow in your next web application.  
  
The Grails Web Flow plugin allows you to use Spring Web Flow in your Grails app using a newly created DSL designed specifically for the Web Flow plugin.  
We will be developing an application from the ground up using Grails and then using the web flow plugin to control navigation and retain state through different flows in our app.  
This presentation does NOT assume you have any knowledge of Spring Webflow. Some basic knowledge of Groovy and Grails will be beneficial.
