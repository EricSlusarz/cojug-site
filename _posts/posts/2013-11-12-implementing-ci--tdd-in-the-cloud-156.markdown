 **Abstract**

Starting with a simple hello world application on my  
computer we will go from a local program to cloud based version control  
system and graduate to continuous integration and test driven development  
in the cloud.&nbsp; This will be a specific demonstration using Jenkins,  
Github, JUnit on the CloudBees SAAS platform.
