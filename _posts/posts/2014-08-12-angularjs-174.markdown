 **Abstract**

Most JavaScript frameworks dislike HTML. They treat it as a limitation that needs to be cast away as soon as possible. They either replace it with a new template system, or they build up the view by directly manipulating the DOM.  
  
AngularJS sees the problem differently. It choose to build the view system on top of HTML. It extends HTML to provide two way data binding, validation, REST support, and the concept of reusable components. It let you create clean testable controller using plain JavaScript.   
  
Of course, the first question people always ask is, who uses it? These days it feels like a new JavaScript framework is announced weekly. Google use AngularJS for the DoubleClick platform rewrite.   
  
Come see how AngularJS can change your web development experience.
