 **Abstract**

For years Relational Databases have remained king in the market. As needs have become more nuanced and data has become “big”, there has become a need for more pragmatic data stores. Enter Neo4J, a great Java-based graph database that allows for lightning fast traversal of relationships. In this presentation we will answer the question, what is Graph Theory? Next we will contrast using a graph database as opposed to other options such as relational databases. Finally we will look into Neo4J, exploring its opinionate design and learning the different ways to interface with it. This presentation will be designed for those with limited experience in the Neo4j. So come join us and learn a new way to look at data!
