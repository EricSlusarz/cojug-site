 **Abstract**

An architecture walkthrough of an extensible, model based DSL built on top of Eclipse projects – EMF, GMF, WST, and JDT.

- Eclipse is infrastructure which makes the model DSL possible through OSGI and specialized tooling
- DSL Core is the DSL for RIA and WS along with the core persistence and indexing engines
- DSL Services is responsible for management and extensibility of all DSL artifacts
- DSL Editing is responsible for the display and editing management of all model artifacts
- DSL Adaptation is the core of how external models and artifacts are interacted with by the DSL
- DSL 2 Implementation is responsible for the defining of DSL to code mappings and the generation of code artifacts
- Demo of Skyway Software’s DSL to illustrate the implementation of the above architecture
