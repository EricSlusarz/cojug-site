 **Abstract**

Concurrency is a term that is quite common in the Java literature.&nbsp; Many Java developers understand the term and how to use at least the most primitive tools for Concurrency, such as threads.&nbsp; Contrastingly, Parallel Programming is not a term that is common in the Java literature.&nbsp; It is unlikely that as many developers understand even the fundamentals of Parallel Programming as those who understand Java threads.&nbsp; Because dual-core processors are already common in desktop computers and multi-processor servers are already in production, programming to take advantage of this concurrent processing power is not merely a concern for the future, but one for the present.

Java developers would be wise to make themselves more aware of Concurrency and Parallel Programming.&nbsp; To better equip you as a Java developer, this talk will teach you some of the fundamental terminology and theories of Parallel Programming.&nbsp; It will also display the state of Parallel Programming for the Java language and the hardware it can run on.&nbsp;
