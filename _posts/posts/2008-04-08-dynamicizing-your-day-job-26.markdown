 **Abstract**

So, you want to use a dynamic language like Groovy or JRuby because you are sure that it is the future of Java. Just one problem: your company is soooo conservative that they won't let anything cool past the guard house. Solution? Dynamicize your job. This session includes 5 extended examples of how to use Groovy and JRuby as part of your daily development without actually deploying any of it. It discusses using dynamic languages for unit and functional testing (including mock objects and behavior driven development), taking control of the XML sprawl of configuration files, using Groovy and JRuby for code generation and reflection, using these languages to automate common developer tasks (i.e., building shims and jigs in Groovy), and finally using build tools built in Groovy and Ruby (Gant, Jake, and Raven). The goal of this session is to allow you to start using cool tools Monday morning...and no one who cares for the wrong reasons needs to be the wiser!
