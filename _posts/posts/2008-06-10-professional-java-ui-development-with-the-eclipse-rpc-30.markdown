 **Abstract**

Learn how to build featured rich applications using the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. The Eclipse platform is an open tools platform, on top of this platform you can build your own applications (which do not need to be IDE like or IDE related). Yet you can enjoy the benefits of working with a mature and featured rich platform that can greatly reduce the amount of time required to create a professional-looking and robust Java UI application.
