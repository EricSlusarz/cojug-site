 **Abstract**

Kotlin is the newest contender in the programming language arena. It has all the modern language features you love, a refreshingly concise syntax, and it runs almost anywhere (JVM, Android, JS, Native). In this presentation, you’ll get a thorough introduction to the Kotlin syntax and features and see what makes it a language worth considering.

**Bio**

John Keyes is the Forward Engineering Lead for Fuse by Cardinal Health. Don’t know what that means? That’s OK, he doesn’t either. But, he does get to spend his days helping teams apply technology to their new and innovative ideas. His travels have taken him all over the technological globe: web, mobile, cloud, big data, little data, microservices, microcontrollers, and beyond. In his spare time, he is an avid runner and self-proclaimed taco connoisseur.
