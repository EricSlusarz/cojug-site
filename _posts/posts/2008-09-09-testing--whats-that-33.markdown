 **Abstract**

Vital to any development is the ability to test that application. Often time developers use excuses as to why NOT to test. One of those excuses is not knowing HOW to test. Testing can be as simple as writing code to go against your method and expecting a certain result. However most applications have a variety of moving parts that include databases or outside services that we do not want to test. Luckily Java has created multiple ways of helping to test out outside services, and we shall go over four of those ways. The first two will look at Easy Mock and JMockit which can be used by any framework. The third one will be specific for EJB3Unit testing and our last example of testing will look at how to test against JBoss Embedded application server.
