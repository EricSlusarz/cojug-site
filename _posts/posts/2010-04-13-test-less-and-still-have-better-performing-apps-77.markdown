 **Abstract**

While every development team should have a full complement of profiling, testing and load generation tools at their disposal, it's important to know that most applications will still see some issues once they are deployed into production.&nbsp; One the other hand, recognizing this, some teams have dramatically shortened their pre-prod testing cycles and push new development iterations into production with minimal testing, relying on production monitoring to identify any new issues that arise. Bjorn will discuss how your team can become more agile, test less without adding more risk, and spot production performance problems. He will show some examples from New Relic customers' applications.

**Bio**

Bjorn is proud to be part of the engineering team at New Relic, officially as the Director of Engineering, but unofficially as a software psychologist. He spends his day listening to the software tell him about its troubles, and then works to resolve the problems, be they technical, process, or people-related. He's passionate about delivering value to customers and loves that continuous improvements that delivering software as a service enables. Bjorn has worked in open source, closed source, big companies, small companies, and even as a university professor (Eclipse, Amazon, Rational, Gemstone, OTI, ...). He has an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, and is happy to talk at length about his passion for orienteering and/or his love of flying.
