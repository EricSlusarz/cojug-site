 **Abstract**

Today's applications have lots of operational expectations such as availability, performance and predictability. Fortunately the Java Platform is mature and battled tested across many enterprises which caused the introduction of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) in Java SE 5.0 for managing and monitoring the JVM, frameworks and even your own application. During this session you will learn how to use JMX, VisualVM and custom scripts to manage and monitor your applications as well as how to expose parts of your application through JMX.
