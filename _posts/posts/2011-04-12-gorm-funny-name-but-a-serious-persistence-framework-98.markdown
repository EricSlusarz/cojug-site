 **Abstract**

Grails&nbsp; object relational mapping (GORM) is one of the most powerful features of the Grails framework.&nbsp; Project bootstrapping and CRUD scaffolding are nice things to get you started, but GORM continues to pay off throughout the development of an application.&nbsp; Even maintenance tasks become simpler and more fun with GORM.&nbsp;

In this presentation we’ll discover what GORM is and what it does for us.&nbsp; We’ll cover dynamic domain class methods, dynamic finders, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, Hibernate Criteria Builders and more.&nbsp; We’ll also take a look at some things to watch out for since, after all, this is Object Relational Mapping we’re talking about.&nbsp;
