 **Abstract**

So what is wrong with building web applications for the JVM? It’s not fun anymore. Something is missing from the experience.The type of web applications we are building has changed.Today’s web applications are integrating more real-time data, have more scalability requirements, and need to be more user-friendly. However, the web frameworks that we use to build web applications for the JVM haven’t improved very much.  
So what do we need? We need a framework that makes web development fun and easy by combining the new client-side technologies like HTML5, LESS, and CoffeeScript, with server-side tools that provide scalability and development ease so that you can focus on solving business problems using tool that meets today’s demand. Play Framework combines the best tools from the Java and Scala worlds with the latest client-side technologies so that you can be productive from start. I think the best way to explore this framework is to jump in and build application and that is exactly what are we going to in this presentation - Build a full working HTML5 application.
