 **Abstract**

Whether you have one or a million visitors accessing your application, they are all going to demand a great user experience regardless of what it takes for you to deliver it. This invariably means quick page loads and fast response times every single time. Grant will talk about different ways to start scaling your application with "Cloud" technology. He will take a spatial web/mapping service and hit it with load and watch OpenShift just start adding new "servers" to handle the load. Grant will show how to load test your application, some gotchas, and how to begin to look at results. No proprietary solutions needed - it's all open source with a hosted version and a private version.&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Shipley will discuss the future of the OpenShift Origin open source project and integration with both Docker and Kubernetes.
