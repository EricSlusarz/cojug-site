 **Abstract**

With GUI programs in abundance to help us with our everyday job it is easy to go years without touching a command line.&nbsp; Like most things in life: “if you don’t use it, you lose it.”&nbsp; In this talk we’ll use real world examples to show how you can automate and be more efficient at the things you do all day every day with some simple commands.&nbsp; We will also talk about how you can start to incorporate these tools into your everyday workflow so that you don’t ‘lose it’.
