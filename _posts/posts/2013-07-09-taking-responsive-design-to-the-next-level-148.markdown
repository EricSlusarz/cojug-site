 **Abstract**

We all know that responsive web design is more than just a hot topic— it's revolutionizing the way we design, code and write for the web. By now, many of us have played with media queries and have a basic understanding of how responsive design works (and if you don't, this session will give you a crash course!). But there's a whole lot more that goes into crafting truly great responsive experiences. We'll talk about advanced principles of responsive design, techniques for improving page performance, considerations for using responsive for e-commerce or enterprise sites, and highlight best practices and patterns that can help take your next responsive project to the next level.
