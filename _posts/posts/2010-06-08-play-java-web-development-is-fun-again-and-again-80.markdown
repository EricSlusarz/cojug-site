 **Abstract**

The state of Java web development is in pretty sad shape. The first problem is, there are plenty of web frameworks to choose from and each one looks very similar to other. This does not help us when time comes to decide which Java framework to use for the next project. The second problem in the Java web development space is the boilerplate code and configuration required by some frameworks which makes building simple crud applications couple of weeks effort. The obvious question is, whether there is hope for Java developers to have fun again building web applications or we all have to move to promising world of grails and rails?  
  
The answer is yes it is still possible to have fun building web applications in Java if you select the right framework.  
  
The play framework is a Java web framework that brings fun back into Java web development. I know the common reaction to the answer is “oh no, not another framework” but smart defaults, conventions, powerful JPA and REST makes play framework one of the most exciting web framework in the Java land. In this presentation we will introduce play framework to the audience through examples.&nbsp;   
  
By end of the presentation it will be clear that problems with the current Java web development is not the problem of the language but rather the existing frameworks that we use to build web application and play addresses those problems nicely. This makes play a very good web framework for Java.
