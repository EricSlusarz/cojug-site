 **Abstract**

Mobile application responsiveness can make or break user experience. It is dramatically apparent when an application hangs for fractions of a second. On mobile devices that traditionally have less memory than their desktop counter parts, it is important to write code in such a way that resource intensive operations do not impact the experience. This often means asynchronous programming. The Android platform has numerous ways of writing asynchronous code. This session will explore many of the paradigms for handling asynchronous code on Android, including async tasks, adapters, services, loaders, queues, and events. Pros and cons and appropriate situations for these approaches will be discussed. Developers attending this session will leave with the tools to load data asynchronously and provide the smoothest UI experience for users of their Android applications.

**Bio**

John Pendexter is a passionate Java developer and consultant at Manifest Solutions. He has been writing apps for the Android platform since Froyo. He believes that care taken with asynchronous problem solving makes for a dramatically better user experience. When not writing code John enjoys exploring the reservoirs and rivers in his kayak around Columbus, Ohio and learning to play the mandolin.
