 **Abstract**

Software teams are always asked to do more with less, but in economic times like these, it becomes even tougher. Our workloads stay the same through layoffs and downsizings. "Do the same work (or more!) with fewer people" is our new mandate. We've got to find ways to tighten our feedback loops, but still be sure we're getting the right work done. This training focuses on five key areas to help you do this: requirements, execution, testing, deployment, and maintenance.  
  
These tools and ideas can be used in various ways to address the area your team needs to tune-up. You'll bring fast feedback to your team, your customers, and your management. These tight feedback loops provide more transparency, bring more comfort to everyone involved, and mitigate risk on your project.
