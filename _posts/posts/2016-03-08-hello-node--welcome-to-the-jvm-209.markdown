 **Abstract**

Let’s face facts - eventually we will all be Node.js developers. The ease of development that comes from using the same language on both the client and the server, and the explosion of libraries, frameworks, and tools available in Javascript makes for a compelling combination. At the same time, the big iron that runs compiled languages and enterprise data centers isn’t going away either. What if there were a way to combine the two, leveraging both the existing investment in Java, and the programming benefits of the same language everywhere?&nbsp; In this presentation, we’ll take a look at three ways Node.js and its ecosystem can be merged with the JVM. We’ll explore some examples on each implementation, look at how each implementation works internally, what is possible right now on each platform, and what the plans are for each in the future.
