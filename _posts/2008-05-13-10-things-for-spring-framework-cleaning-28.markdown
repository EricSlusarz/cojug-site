 **Abstract**

No single technology or framework has changed the landscape of Java development as the Spring Framework has over the last 4 years. The days of complex, time consuming, and untestable APIs and specifications are now a distant memory. They have since been replaced with Spring enabled applications that are simple enough to develop for the majority of cases, yet flexible and powerful enough to tackle the difficult fringe scenarios.  
  
This talk aims to give the every day Java developer a few more tools to add to their Spring enabled toolbelt. It will cover some obscure features of Spring that you've been largely unaware of like the JAMon performance monitoring, and dynamic language support. Additionally, it will cover some of the powerful facilities provided by Spring that have not been widely adopted like Spring Security for data masking, Caching support with pluggable cache providers, and scheduling support with Quartz.
