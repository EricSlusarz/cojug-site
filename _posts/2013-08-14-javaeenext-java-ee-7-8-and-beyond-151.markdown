Java EE 7 is here and the horizons for Java EE 8 are emerging. This session looks into the key changes the community can expect. The goal of this session is to foster interest and discussion around these changes.  
  
Some of the changes discussed include retiring EJB 2 entity beans and JAX-RPC, greater alignment with CDI, WebSocket/HTML 5 support, a standard API for JSON processing, the next version of JAX-RS, an overhaul of JMS, long-awaited concurrency utilities, batch processing in Java EE and much, much more.
