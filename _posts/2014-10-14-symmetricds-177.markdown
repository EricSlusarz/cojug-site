 **Abstract**

SymmetricDS is an open source data synchronization server that can replicate data continuously between multiple databases.&nbsp; Written as a Java web application, it can be configured to use Java code and scripts to perform filtering, routing, and transformation of data.&nbsp; It includes Java extension points and can be embedded within desktop and mobile applications for further customization.&nbsp; Designed to scale for a large number of databases and operate in disconnected mode, it can sync thousands of nodes and operate reliably across low bandwidth networks.&nbsp; Flexible configuration and support for more than a dozen database platforms makes it a useful tool for data integration projects.
