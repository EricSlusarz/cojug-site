 **Abstract**

What does it take to make an Android application run on a TV?&nbsp; This talk will take a look at the design considerations that one must take into account when designing for the TV. While many android tablet apps will work on an Android TV device with a few tweaks, there are navigation and visual considerations to address.&nbsp;   
  
We'll take a look at Serenity for Android a client for the Plex Media Server specifically designed for the 10 foot viewing experience.&nbsp; Topics include what is "Android TV", design considerations for your apps to run on these devices, approaches to handling navigation, visual layout, and user interaction.&nbsp; All of these considerations help make or break a TV app.&nbsp;&nbsp; What works well on a tablet or phone will more than likely flop from a user experience on a TV.&nbsp; We'll look at some existing apps the Patterns and Anti-Patterns that either make a break a app from a users perspective. We'll do some comparison with Chromecast, why Android TV is viable option, and why the two platforms&nbsp; are not mutually exclusive.
