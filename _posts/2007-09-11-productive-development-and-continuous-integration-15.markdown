 **Abstract**

Productivity is about more than just hard work. It's about using tools that intelligently amplify your abilities, speed up your progress, and handle time-consuming tasks for you, so you can focus on the work ahead. Leveraging the right tools, we can make ourselves and our team more productive while at the same time having great pleasure writing code.  
   
 The first part of this presentation, mixed with various live demonstrations, focuses on how your IDE should serve you, anticipate your needs, and help you to develop at the speed of thought. We are going to cover various topics – by looking at code examples – like unobtrusive assistance, predictive code editing, refactoring support, real-time code analysis, and how these powerful features apply to Java, XML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web 2.0 applications, spending most of the time on live-action code crunching and some on the philosophy of productive coding. The concepts will be demonstrated using IntelliJ IDEA.  
   
 In the second part of this presentation, also mixed with many live demonstrations, we zoom out to look at development from a team perspective. We will discuss the why's and how's of Continuous Integration (CI), identify the bottle-necks of current CI tools, and illustrate how innovative ideas like remote runs, delayed commits, build agents, and server-side code analysis can make team development much more productive and pleasant. The concepts will be illustrated using TeamCity.  
   
 Overall, if you would like to know how state-of-the-art tools like IntelliJ IDEA and TeamCity can make yourself and your team more productive with pleasure, this is a good opportunity. Code examples and general concepts are key to this presentation, so if you were hoping for a pure marketing show... well, this one's not for you&nbsp; :)
