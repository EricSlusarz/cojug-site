 **Abstract**

Continuous integration (CI) is a critical practice that modern software development teams have employed because it helps them build confidence in the software they are developing and the team they are doing it with. The practice of CI is a key tenant in getting the flywheel spinning for software projects by helping to keep integration issues in check, defect rates down, and test coverage and code quality high. Without a good feedback loop a project can come to a screeching halt and integration becomes painful.   
  
The Hudson project is an opensource Java web application that helps with the automation of CI by building, testing, and deploying the software. In this session you will learn how to use Hudson for your own software projects and how to configure it with very little effort.
