 **Abstract**

Searching is an integral part of many applications today and yet it can still be difficult to integrate search into an application well. Search becomes even more challenging when you consider searching across an enterprise or need to support a large scale. This presentation will explain how you can simplify searching with the open source enterprise search engine, Apache Solr. By the end of the presentation you will understand the relationship between Apache Lucene and Solr, how to create search documents, populate search documents all using Solr's easy REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs. We will also look at some of the more interesting document mapping strategies and maybe even at some of the geo spacial searching capabilities.
