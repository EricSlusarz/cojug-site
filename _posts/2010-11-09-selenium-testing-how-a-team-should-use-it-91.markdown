 **Abstract**  
  
Selenium, the open-source web application black-box testing tool, is very powerful, and very dangerous. What are the potential benefits and dangers? How do you determine when to use it, when not? How do you determine how to use it, and how not?  
&nbsp;  
I'll cover healthy and unhealthy patterns for using Selenium. This includes cultural and interpersonal patterns, strictly technical patterns, and "testing-triangle" "Definition-of-Done" patterns. I'll discuss how Web 2.0 trends (especially dynamic HTML of all kinds) effect Selenium testing and all web app testing.   
&nbsp;  
I'll also discuss where the Selenium project is headed, why, and how long it will take to "get there."
