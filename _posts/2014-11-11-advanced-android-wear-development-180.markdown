 **Abstract**

Android Wear extends the Android Platform for new generation of devices that can be worn on a body. Android Wear API allows to enhance app notifications and build native applications to provide an optimized user experience on Android wearables.  
&nbsp;  
In my last session at COJUG, I covered Wear notifications overview, design principles and demo various mechanisms that would allow connected devices to send notifications to Wear devices.  
&nbsp;  
In this session of Android Wear, I will cover more advanced details with demo on developing, packaging and deploying native applications (apk) on a Wear&nbsp; device. I will also discuss a communication mechanism that would allow Wear device to exchange messages with its connected device.
