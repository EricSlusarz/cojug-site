 **Abstract**

This talk provides an introduction to the topic of microservices and demonstrates how to build microservice based applications with Spring Cloud technologies. We'll take a look at the different Spring Cloud projects such as Config Server & Bus, Eureka, Ribbon, Feign, and Hystrix, so we can see how they are used to implement a microservice based architecture. We'll also talk about the advantages and disadvantages of microservices and how to use Spring Data, Spring Data REST and HATEOS to build robust RESTful web services.
