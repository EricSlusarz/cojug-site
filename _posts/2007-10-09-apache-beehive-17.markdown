 **Abstract**

Apache Beehive's goal is to make J2EE programming easier by building a simple object model on J2EE and Struts. Using the new JSR-175 and  
  
JSR-181 metadata annotations Beehive reduces the coding necessary for J2EE. The initial Beehive project has three pieces.  
  
NetUI PageFlows - A web application framework built on top of Struts allowing easier tooling as well as automatic updating of Struts configuration files with the use of metadata.  
  
Controls - Lightweight component framework that helps programmers build components that incorporate metadata into their programming model.  
  
Web Services - An Implementation of JSR-181, an annotation driven programming model for web services.  
  
We will discuss Beehive and walk through a demo.
