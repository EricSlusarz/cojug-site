Abstract  
  
"Android OS is based on a popular Linux Operating System and is currently developed and maintained by Open Handset Alliance. It allows developers to write application using Java programming language. As you all may know that Java is a very popular development language for various platforms and this makes application development for Android much simpler for Java developers. Android SDK is very feature rich but at same time very simple to use. There are around 50,000+ Android applications available at Android Market Place. Some of very popular Android devices are: Google Nexus One, Motorola Droid, Droid 2, Droid X, HTC Incredible, Samsung Galaxy, T-Mobile G1/G2, T-Mobile MyTouch. Another newly released Android based 7" tablet from Samsung, is a feature packed tablet device similar to iPad but with additional features.
