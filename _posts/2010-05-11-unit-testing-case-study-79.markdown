 **Abstract**

Unit Testing Case Study: How Ohio Mutual Insurance Group Got Started

The splendor of unit testing that you've been seized by at the last software engineering conference or reading dreamily about in blogs and magazines is probably true....mostly.&nbsp; Unit testing is necessary and is a rigor that all Software Engineers should follow.&nbsp; The part that gets glazed over, left out or misrepresented is how hard it is to actually get started.&nbsp; That is, at least, the experience that I and my co-workers have had at Ohio Mutual Insurance Group.&nbsp; I suspect that if you've tried to start unit testing you were left as confused as we were.&nbsp; Just as we were, you were probably brimming with excitement but dumbfounded at the prospect of actually beginning.&nbsp; Starting a unit testing discipline is possible.&nbsp; The problems that keep you from starting are surmountable.&nbsp; In this talk I will provide a case study for how Ohio Mutual Insurance Group overcame the problems with writing our first unit tests by showing you some of our actual production code.&nbsp; I'll explain the code that gave us fits and show you the testing methods we used to circumvent the problems.&nbsp;
