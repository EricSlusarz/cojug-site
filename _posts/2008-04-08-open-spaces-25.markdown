 **Abstract**

We are going to try something new this meeting. We are going to try to apply the Open Spaces concept. This means we have no set topic or agenda so bring your own thoughts, ideas, questions or comments. We may only get through one or we may get through a bunch. Here are some ideas and questions to get you thinking. Feel free to bring power point slides on a thumb drive or posters to help illustrate your point.  
  
\* Are you or your company using social network platforms? If so how? Does your company take advantage of the twitter platform?  
\* Does your company target mobile platforms? If so which platforms? Which mobile platforms interest you? What types of mobile applications do you need or want? How much mobility is in your domain? Would your customers use mobile applications?  
\* Are you using scripting languages? If so which ones? How are you using them? What advantages have you found? Are you using them in production? Do you run these scripting languages on the JVM?  
\* Which web frameworks are you using? Which JavaScript/AJAX frameworks are you using? What challenges do you have?  
\* If you could get one thing in Java 7, what would it be?  
\* Which open source project are you really excited about?  
\* What is your favorite IDE/development tool and why?  
\* What is the Central Ohio Java job market like?

**Bio**

You!!!
