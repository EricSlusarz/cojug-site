 **Abstract**

Concurrency in Java is difficult. It's easy to introduce subtle bugs that show up inconsistently. Akka is a framework for the JVM that makes writing highly concurrent code simpler. In addition, Akka's actor model supports extremely reliable applications and horizontal scalability. It's a great choice for real time systems or architectures like event sourcing or CQRS. This presentation will introduce Akka and its actor model.
