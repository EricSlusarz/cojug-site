**Abstract**

JBoss Seam started off as an agile framework to seamlessly integrate JSF and EJB3. Since it’s birth it has not only can do that but has expanded to link AJAX and jBPM as well. In addition the Seam components can not only be created in EJB3 but now as JavaBeans, Groovy objects, and even injected into Spring. The end result is smooth and easily manageable code without the plumbing usually required for functionality. We will go through what Seam has to offer, and what functionality it can bring to your company.
