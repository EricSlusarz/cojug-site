 **Abstract**

For years most have been creating relational databases almost by heart. These were the the database systems we learned in college and the database systems we implemented in real life. We then spent years optimizing them and trying to adjust them for use that they weren't designed to do. They were shown to have poor performance on some data intense applications. Especially websites that received tons of traffic. For years we simply tried to optimize and optimize the database till in the late 90s and early 2000s when web traffic really started to explode.  
  
At that time the concept of NoSQL came about, by Johan Oskarsson of Last.fm. With NoSQL there are no fixed table schemas and typically scale horizontally. Since that time many NoSQL choices have been developed and are being used at high visible websites world wide.  
  
I will present MongoDB which is used by FourSquare today. MongoDB is a highly scalable NoSql database that allows allows for geo spatial indexing. In the presentation we will go over the following:  
- How to setup and run your mongo database locally, as well as how to design your database including database considerations that one normally doesn't think of in traditional RDBS design.   
- Creating / Updating / Deleting from Mongo  
- Creating queries in Mongo  
- Storing files in Mongo with GridFS  
- Geo spatial querying in Mongo
