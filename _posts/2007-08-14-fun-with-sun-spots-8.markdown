 **Abstract**  
  
Sun SPOTs (small programmable object technology) are a research project from Sun Labs.&nbsp; They are intended to be used in applications like wireless sensor networks, but have many other interesting and fun applications.&nbsp; This session will explain the design of the Sun SPOTs, including the Squawk JVM which requires no operating system to run. Possible uses of the SPOTs in different applications including gaming will be described along with a number of interesting and thought provoking demonstrations of their use.
