 **Abstract**

Cucumber-JVM is a functional testing tool that allows you to write cucumber tests in Java. It is a port to the JVM of the popular functional testing framework Cucumber, and an upgraded version of Cuke4Duke. In this talk I will go over the benefits a Java project can gain using Cucumber-JVM, as well as how to setup a project to use Cucumber-JVM.
