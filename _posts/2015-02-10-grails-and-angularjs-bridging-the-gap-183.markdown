 **Abstract**

I will be presenting on my personal experience integrating existing Grails applications with AngularJS. Most Grails developers rely on GSPs to display structured data, however, this can be cumbersome. With the introduction of AngularJS, a powerful client MVC platform, the client's browser can help provide a dynamic and light UI experience. We will explore how Angular directives, controllers and services can integrate with Grails controllers, web sockets and more. We will ensure functionality and code quality throughout the stack using Jasmine, Spock and CucumberJs tests.
