 **Abstract**  

An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) infrastructure is a low-cost implementation method of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In June 2005, 20+ major infrastructure players including Sun, Oracle, and Tibco combined their knowledge to establish an open standard for building ESBs. Together through the Java Community Process, a new specification was created, Java Business Integration (JSR-208), defining a vendor-independent, pluggable framework for constructing an Enterprise Service Bus.

 This talk focuses on the JBI specification -- from introducing the basic architecture to disclosing some of the development complexities open standards can bring. In this session, discover which JBI-compliant ESB products on the market today, and walk-through a simple “Hello World” JBI component built using one of those products, Apache ServiceMix. The session finishes with a Loan Broker use case example, illustrating how to reduce the JBI learning curve by configuring JBI compliant components through publicly-available Eclipse plug-ins.
