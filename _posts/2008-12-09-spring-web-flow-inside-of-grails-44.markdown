 **Abstract**

One of the hottest new features coming out of the spring team is Spring Web Flow. With the 2.0 released recently, it will start to gain even more support. What is Spring Web Flow you ask? Simply it is a way one can easily construct the flow of the website without having to make the services aware of what page the service should forward to next. However, this is not just about controlling the flow, with Spring Web Flow one is able to keep state of the objects for the duration of the flow, one is able to stop someone from entering in the middle of the flow, and most importantly one can create alternate paths inside the flow. All of these features give your application added functionality that it didn't have before and with less code than would take for one to implement by themselves.

So what's the downside to Spring Web Flow? It's written and defined in XML. However, with the Spring Web Flow integration with Grails that will not be the case. We are able to design flows with Groovy for a truly readable representation. Using the groovy builder syntax to define the flow, this presentation will show how one uses Spring Web Flow and how easy it is to integrate it inside our Grails applications.
