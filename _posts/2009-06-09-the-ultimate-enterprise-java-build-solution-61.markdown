 **Abstract**

Enterprise Java applications commonly take advantage of the rich Java ecosystem causing them to contain dozens of dependencies on open source and commercial libraries. Combined that with large and sometimes distributed development teams, tight deadlines and multiple development streams and it becomes amazing a functional release can ever be delivered. To help manage the chaos of dealing with builds, integration, dependency management, artifact distribution and reporting there are five open source projects that combine make the Ultimate Enterprise Java Build Solution. This presentation will show how you can combine Maven, Subversion, Hudson, Nexus and Sonar to simplify development, improve quality and give you more time to enjoy life.
