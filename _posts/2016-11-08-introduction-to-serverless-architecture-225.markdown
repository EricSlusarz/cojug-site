 **Abstract**

Are you worried about the scalability and availability of your application?&nbsp; Do you find you or your team spending a lot of time deploying and managing servers?&nbsp; With buzzwords like “Serverless”, “BaaS”, “FaaS”, and “cloud" getting thrown around almost interchangeably it’s easy to have some confusion on what “Serverless" really means.&nbsp; In this talk we’ll discuss these terms and show how a Serverless Architecture can help solve some of your problems.&nbsp; Lastly we’ll go through an example using AWS services (specifically Lambada and API Gateway).
