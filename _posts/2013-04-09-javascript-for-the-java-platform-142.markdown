 **Abstract**

JavaScript is not just for browsers anymore. It has permeated just about any environment code can run on today including the Java Platform. This presentation will give you a taste of what you can do with JavaScript today using the Scripting API (JSR 223) provided by Java SE 6 as well as the exciting new JavaScript capabilities coming in Java SE 8 using the new Nashorn JavaScript engine as well as the new Java API for JSON processing (JSR 353).
