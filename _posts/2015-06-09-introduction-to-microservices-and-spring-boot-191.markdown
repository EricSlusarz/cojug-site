 **Abstract**

This session starts with an introduction to Microservices then shifts to how Spring Boot can help simplify their delivery.  
&nbsp;  
Microservices are becoming more popular and are helping some companies deliver on the agile promises.&nbsp; We will explore their attributes and what makes them successful. Then we will find out why the Spring Framework complements these attributes and delivers standalone applications easier than ever before.  
&nbsp;  
We will learn how to create a simple standalone service using just a few lines of code.&nbsp; Next we will look at how opinionated Spring can help teams get up and running and allow their focus to be on the features instead of the plumbing.
