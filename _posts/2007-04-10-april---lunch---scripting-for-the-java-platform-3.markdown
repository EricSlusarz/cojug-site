 **Abstract**

&nbsp; The Java Platform has always been a great platform for scripting languages. Historically scripting support has been provided by open source projects. However with the advent of JSR 223 and Java 6, scripting language support becomes a first class citizen. In this session, you will learn how to take advantage of this powerful new feature.
