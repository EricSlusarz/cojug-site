 **Abstract**

There’s no less than 50 viable tools for developing automated unit, functional, and integration tests in Java. Unfortunately, many of these tools are just a different DSL or syntax for the same crap. We’ve found five tools for testing Java applications that we use across projects to develop automated tests that are quickly executed, extensive, and extremely readable by other developers. This talk will provide some extensive hands on knowledge of how to use  
Hamcrest, Mockito, Jmockit, InnerClasses, and Spring.test. Developers will walk away with a smaller, but more powerful toolbox of testing utilities.
