 **Abstract**

Why Scala? A new age of JVM is upon us. JVM is no longer just for Java. As Groovy, Jython, and JRuby has proved, there is life for other languages on the JVM. Scala is different than most of the other popular JVM alternative languages. We’ll explore the origin, intent and the philosophy of the Scala programming language.&nbsp; The unique combination of OOP and Functional programming will be presented. Major features of Scala such as actors, type inference and Java integration will also be discussed.
