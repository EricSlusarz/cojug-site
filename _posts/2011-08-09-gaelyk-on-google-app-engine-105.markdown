 **Abstract**

Most of us have had to face the challenge of delivering products at the right scale with the right level of resources. A lot of work goes into estimating the needs of the stack. All of us at one time or another have thought, “Why can’t this all be done automatically for me so I can focus on the product?”  
  
Wouldn’t it be great if you can develop a web application by using a dynamic language (Groovy) with an easy to use template system (Groovy Template)? It needs to be backed by a solid NOSQL system (Google BigTable), have dedicated caching system that’s not tied to each application server (memcached), and you can deploy it to an application server (Jetty) using well understood packaging format (WAR). It of couse needs to handle running multiple versions of the application, and have the application server automatically spin up/down instances as needed. It should have a good url routing system for both human and SEO friendly urls, support Comet (Channel), a messaging system, a URL fetching system to build your own bots, a high speed email delivery system that has very little issues with false positive spam check, and a high performance image processing/delivery system. All of this should be wrapped up in an easy to use DSL and can handle being Digged or Slashedoted.  
  
Oh and please make my first 5 million page views free. Doing startup is hard enough, we don’t have money.   
  
Come see Gaelyk on Google App Engine.
