 **Abstract**

The most common way to implement access token in web applications is using cookies. Cookies as access token have served well over the years but they have also contributed to issues with XSRF and CORS requests. As we build applications where web, mobile and micro services come together we need something better than cookies for access token management. Json Web Token (JWT) provides a very compelling alternative and a proven solution. JWT’s help us build applications over multiple stacks, applications that use our own API’s, third party API's, that run in our data center or in the cloud. In this session we will discuss what is JWT, what kind of use cases can be built with JWT and also build an application with AngularJS and Java API’s.
